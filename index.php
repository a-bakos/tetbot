/**
 * IMDB TETbot
 * Trivia Extractor and Tweeter
 *
 * What it does - described briefly:
 * Reads IMDB's trivia section, picks a random fact from them, evaluates it based
 * on some criteria, and if those criteria are met, posts it to Twitter as a
 * tweet. Repeats it randomly within set time boundaries.
 *
 * -------------------------
 * TL;DR - How does it work?
 * -------------------------
 * The basics.
 * The script uses external files that contain unique IDs, extracted from the
 * IMDB database. There are two files to be read: "names.txt" and "movies.txt"
 * Both files are filled with IDs like "tt0108778" [movies], "nm0000151" [names].
 * These IDs are separated by newlines, which is important when reading them, so
 * this is a must. Also, the IDs are in most cases unique - if not, that will
 * not break anything, just the odds will be somewhat distorted, therefore the
 * randomness will be manipulated.
 *
 * About the IDs.
 * On IMDB, every single movie and person has a unique ID and it
 * can be seen in the url of a given page. When you build up your own collection,
 * it is actually pretty easy to export them as a CSV file, and from there the
 * needed IDs can be further exported. These IDs will be used later on to rebuild
 * the urls.
 *
 * Pick the file.
 * A file will be selected randomly, either "names.txt" or "movies.txt".
 * From the selected file, an item (ID) will also be picked randomly.
 *
 * Build the url.
 * The proper url gets created according to the picked item (ID). The url of a
 * movie's page or a person's bio page are slightly different.
 *
 * Find trivia.
 * Then, when the url is done, hit it up, and search for those trivia items.
 * The searching process happens based on regex rules.
 * There could be a few, tens, hundreds, and could be none. If found, the script
 * will extract all of these trivia from the source code and will store them in
 * an array for later processing.
 * If no trivia found, the ID gets recorded a file, called "no_trivia.txt" and
 * the script will reload itself.
 *
 * Process the findings.
 * Since all of the trivia items were placed into an array, there could be some
 * further processing made. First, shuffle the items, and pick one, again,
 * randomly. This is the final "random-round", but the winner trivia can not be
 * announced just yet.
 * Next, the script cuts out most of the unnecessary HTML link tags based on
 * regex rules. (Note: this cut-out process is a bit flaky, the regex rules here
 * have to be improved. Occassionally, it can't determine the exact end point of
 * a link tag and it results in text bits chopped out.)
 * Now, if the script has gotten this far, it is safe to look up the title of the
 * given page, which is a person's name or a movie's title. Save it into a
 * variable and turn it into a hashtag as well. The title will be used in
 * front of the actual tweet, and occassionally its hashtag at the end.
 *
 * Every character gets counted and added together. Titles or names and trivia.
 *
 * Build up the tweet.
 * Twitter-friendliness is depending on several factors. First, if the overall
 * character-count is below 15, skip everything and reload the script -- it can't
 * be a sensible message.
 * Then, there are different rules for various character lengths.
 * Twitter lets 140 characters in a tweet, and its built-in url shortener will
 * reduce any urls down to 23 character.
 * So, count everything in every condition and if the number of characters lets
 * it, append one or more hashtags at the end of the tweet, plus the IMDB url of
 * the movie or person.
 *
 * Send and save.
 * As last steps send the tweet to Twitter, [for this, TwitterOAuth
 * (https://twitteroauth.com/)] is used, and if it made it to Twitter, save the
 * tweet in a file, called "saved_trivia.txt".
 *
 * If the end value is not Twitter-friendly the script gets reloaded, and
 * everything starts over.
 *
 * That's it for now.
